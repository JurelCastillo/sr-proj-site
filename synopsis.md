# Project Synopsis

Language Intelligence has asked RIT to help update its online platform
Intellireview &reg; as part of the senior design project for students applying 
for graduation. Intellireview &reg; was initially written in 2006 using the
programming language '.NET'. It allows Language Intelligence's customers to
review and suggest edits to the translations Language Intelligence performs. 
Intellireview &reg; is special because it shows the translations with all the
relevant formatting and structure.

This project is a continuation of last year's senior design project. The group 
from last year did a wonderful job and we hope to be able to satisfy the
sponsor's expectations again this year.
