# Project Synopsis

The main goal of ClassCal is to create a tool web application with which the faculty of the RIT School of Film and Animation (SOFA) can schedule classes for upcoming semesters using a map of the buildings in which the school operates. Faculty will be able to see a map of which classrooms are reserved within a given building for a certain date and time. Any classrooms that can be scheduled during that time will be shown as open and the faculty can assign a class with specific meeting times to that classroom. This will help centralize the class scheduling process for SOFA, which will help eliminate any communication errors or any other headaches that were already part of the product.

The project currently has implemented logic for scheduling classes and displays an interactive map, but seems to be missing some key features that it will need for a proper release, like authentication. While previously SOFA has operated mostly in the Gannett building, the college will soon be holding classes in the newly constructed MAGIC center. The goal of our team is to add both floors of the MAGIC center to the application and implement the missing functionality from the first release in order to allow SOFA to use the application to schedule classes.
