# Our Process

We decided to use the Spiral software development process model. We believe it 
will fit well with our project because there are many unknowns and risks we
have to consider before moving forward with development.

The Spiral process model will allow us to take time before doing any development
to decide what risks we will be taking in implementing or re-factoring features,
deliverables, and resources, and allow us to devise a strategy to mitigate those
risks. This will also allow us to have many iterations so that our sponsor will
have more information about the project as the project continues.
